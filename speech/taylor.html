This outfit is much more comfortable.</p> <p>I’d like to say a huge thank you to NYU’s chairman of the board of trustees, Bill Berkeley and all the trustees and members of the board, NYU’s president Andrew Hamilton, provost Katherine Fleming, and the faculty and alumni here today who have made this day possible. I feel so proud to share this day with my fellow honorees Susan Hockfield and Felix Matos Rodriguez, who humble me with the ways they improve our world with their work. As for me, I’m … 90% sure the main reason I’m here is because I have a song called ‘22’. And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York University’s class of 2022.</p> <p>Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness or told us the truth even when it wasn’t easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you and taught you to dream and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you, as you asked a bazillion questions like ‘how does the moon work’ and ‘why can we eat salad but not grass.’ And maybe they didn’t do it perfectly. No one ever can. Maybe they aren’t with us anymore, and in that case I hope you’ll remember them today. If they are here in this stadium, I hope you’ll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps and missteps that have led us to this common destination.</p> <p>I know that words are supposed to be my ‘thing,’ but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and my dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day so that I could go from singing in coffee houses to standing up here with you all today because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: welcome to New York. It’s been waiting for you.</p> <p>I’d like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a doctor. Not the type of doctor you would want around in the case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute.</p> <p>I never got to have the normal college experience, per se. I went to public high school until tenth grade and finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then I went out on the road on a radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamorous but in reality it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest.</p> <p>As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I’d hang on the wall of my freshmen dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song “Love Story” at my fantasy imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives. Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right? But I really can’t complain about not having a normal college experience to you because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms or having to do classes over zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that you also had to pass like a thousand covid tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted too. But in this case you and I both learned that you don’t always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, you should be very proud of what you’ve done with it. Today you leave New York University and then you go out into the world searching for what’s next. And so will I.</p> <p>So as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice unless they ask for it. I’ll go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation, to impart whatever wisdom I might have and tell you the things that helped me in my life so far. Please bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. You’ve worked and struggled and sacrificed and studied and dreamed your way here today and so, you know what you’re doing. You’ll do things differently than I did them.</p> <p>I won’t tell you to live without fear. I think fear is a useful thing to have. Fear can be a guiding light, a warning sign, an indication that something needs your attention. But what I will tell you is to not let fear stop you from doing what you love. I spent years being afraid of what people would think of me, of making mistakes, of not being good enough. And those fears held me back in so many ways. It wasn’t until I decided to face those fears head-on that I was able to grow and evolve as an artist and as a person.</p> <p>I know that in this day and age, it’s easy to get caught up in the comparison game. We live in a world where we are constantly bombarded with images of perfection, of people who seem to have it all together. But I want you to remember that no one’s life is as perfect as it seems on social media. Everyone has their struggles, their insecurities, their failures. And that’s okay. It’s part of being human. So don’t compare your behind-the-scenes to someone else’s highlight reel. Focus on your own journey, on your own growth, on your own happiness.</p> <p>Another thing that has helped me in my life is to surround myself with people who lift me up, who support me, who believe in me. You will meet a lot of people in your life, and not all of them will have your best interests at heart. Some people will try to bring you down, to criticize you, to make you feel small. But you have the power to choose who you let into your inner circle. Surround yourself with people who make you feel good about yourself, who encourage you to be your best self, who celebrate your successes and support you through your failures.</p> <p>And finally, I want to talk about failure. Failure is an inevitable part of life. Everyone fails at some point. I have failed countless times in my career and in my personal life. But the important thing is not to let failure define you. Use it as an opportunity to learn, to grow, to become stronger. Every failure I have ever had has taught me something about myself, about my work, about the world. And those lessons have made me who I am today.</p> <p>So, Class of 2022, as you leave NYU and embark on this new chapter of your lives, I want to leave you with this: be brave, be true to yourself, surround yourself with love and support, and don’t be afraid to fail. You are all capable of achieving great things, and I can’t wait to see what the future holds for you. Congratulations, and thank you for letting me be a part of your special day.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">7/8/2025, 9:45:52 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
