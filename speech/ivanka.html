One year ago, I introduced my father when he declared his candidacy. In his own way, and through his own sheer force of will, he sacrificed greatly to enter the political arena as an outsider.</p> <p>And he prevailed against a field of 16 very talented competitors. For more than a year, Donald Trump has been the people’s champion, and tonight he’s the people’s nominee.</p> <p>Like many of my fellow millennials, I do not consider myself categorically Republican or Democrat. More than party affiliation, I vote on based on what I believe is right, for my family and for my country. Sometimes it’s a tough choice. That is not the case this time. As the proud daughter of your nominee, I am here to tell you that this is the moment and Donald Trump is the person to make America great again.</p> <p>Real change, the kind we have not seen in decades is only going to come from outside the system. And it’s only going to come from a man who’s spent his entire life doing what others said could not be done. My father is a fighter. When the primaries got tough and they were tough, he did what any great leader does. He dug deeper, worked harder, got better and became stronger.</p> <p>I have seen him fight for his family. I have seen him fight for his employees. I have seen him fight for his company. And now, I am seeing him fight for our country. It’s been the story of his life and more recently the spirit of his campaign. It’s also a prelude to reaching the goal that unites us all. When this party and better still this country knows what it is like to win again.</p> <p>If it’s possible to be famous and yet not really well - known, that describes the father who raised me. In the same office in Trump Tower, where we now work together, I remember playing on the floor by my father’s desk, constructing miniature buildings with Legos and Erector sets, while he did the same with concrete, steel and glass.</p> <p>One of my father’s greatest talents is the ability to see potential in people, before they see it in themselves. It was like that for us growing up. He taught us that potential vanishes into nothing without effort.</p> <p>I was born into privilege, but I was raised with the value of responsibility. My father’s mantra has always been “If you can dream it, you can do it.” And he has lived that out in his own life. He has taken risks, he has faced challenges, and he has never given up. That is the same spirit he will bring to the White House.</p> <p>My father has built a great company, but he has also built a great family. He is a loving husband, a devoted father, and a loyal friend. He has taught me the importance of hard work, integrity, and perseverance. And he has shown me what it means to be a true leader.</p> <p>When my father talks about making America great again, he means it. He wants to create jobs, grow the economy, and make our country safer and more prosperous. He wants to restore the American Dream for all Americans.</p> <p>He will cut taxes for middle - class families and small businesses, so you can keep more of your hard - earned money. He will repeal and replace Obamacare, so you can have access to quality, affordable healthcare. He will build a wall on our southern border to stop illegal immigration and drug trafficking. And he will take on the special interests in Washington and put America first.</p> <p>My father is not a politician. He is a businessman, a builder, and a problem - solver. He knows how to get things done. He has a record of success, and he will bring that same level of determination and drive to the presidency.</p> <p>I am proud to be my father’s daughter, and I am proud to support him for President of the United States. He is the right person for the job, and I know he will make America great again.</p> <p>So, on November 8th, I ask you to join me in voting for Donald J. Trump. Let’s come together as a country and put America back on the path to prosperity and greatness. Thank you, and God bless America.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><!----> <div class="last-updated"><span class="prefix">Last Updated:</span> <span class="time">7/8/2025, 9:45:52 PM</span></div></footer> <div class="page-nav"><p class="inner"><span class="prev">
